These classes were attended by Anzaldua, showing a deep interest in the Tarot. Anzaldua demonstrates her knowledge by giving a tarot reading in 1981 to Sally Gearhart[MO2] , an activist[MO3] , novelist, professor active in San Francisco, and co-author of A Feminist Tarot (1981), along with Susan Rennie. In many of the recordings, Anzaldua receives either palm, astrology, or tarot readings. In one such recording, Anzaldua’s palms are read by her friend and fellow scholar Chela Sandoval while Anzaldua visited her in Santa Cruz in July 1983.
