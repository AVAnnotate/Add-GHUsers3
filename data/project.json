These classes were attended by Anzaldua, showing a deep interest in the Tarot. Anzaldua demonstrates her knowledge by giving a tarot reading in 1981 to Sally Gearhart[MO2] , an activist[MO3] , novelist, professor active in San Francisco, and co-author of A Feminist Tarot (1981), along with Susan Rennie. In many of the recordings, Anzaldua receives either palm, astrology, or tarot readings. In one such recording, Anzaldua’s palms are read by her friend and fellow scholar Chela Sandoval while Anzaldua visited her in Santa Cruz in July 1983. In another undated recording, Cherrie Moraga receives an astrology reading from an unidentified practitioner."

In the case of legacy media, both analog and digital, preservation and conservation are critical to the survival of these materials and the knowledge encoded within them, yet it remains a struggle for many archives institutions to attend to the challenges of deterioration, maintaining hardware for playback, and/or the upkeep of maintaining unsupported software and file formats. In this way, AVAnnotate can be used as a tool to preserve transcripts as an alternate mode of access, to augment the researcher experience by providing archival connections between audiovisual materials and other objects in a collection, and to document the materials themselves, beyond the level of the transcript, to include knowledge that might only be gleaned from interacting with the materials in their original formats."

By annotating passages with artifacts from the Anzaldua\nPapers that are relevant either thematically or historically, this exhibit\nmight serve as a jumping off point into what is a considerable collection with\na diverse range of materials. By contextualizing these recordings among the\nbroader collection, we can see just how intertwined Anzaldua’s spiritual\npractices were with her scholarship, her writing process, and her role within a\nlarger community of scholars, teachers, writers, and activists."

In the\ncase of legacy media, both analog and digital, preservation and conservation\nare critical to the survival of these materials and the knowledge encoded\nwithin them, yet it remains a struggle for many archives institutions to attend\nto the challenges of deterioration, maintaining hardware for playback, and/or\nthe upkeep of maintaining unsupported software and file formats. In this way,\nAVAnnotate can be used as a tool to preserve transcripts as an alternate mode\nof access, to augment the researcher experience by providing archival\nconnections between audiovisual materials and other objects in a collection,\nand to document the materials themselves, beyond the level of the transcript,\nto include knowledge that might only be gleaned from interacting with the\nmaterials in their original formats."
